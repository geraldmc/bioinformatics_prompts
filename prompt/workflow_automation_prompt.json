      "response": "\n# RNA-seq Analysis Workflow Design with Nextflow\n\n## Conceptual Approach\n\nFor a scalable RNA-seq pipeline handling hundreds of samples, you should focus on these key design principles:\n\n1. **Modular process design**: Break your workflow into independent, reusable processes\n2. **Containerization**: Use Docker/Singularity containers for each process\n3. **Configuration separation**: Separate your pipeline logic from execution parameters\n4. **Resource management**: Implement dynamic resource allocation\n5. **Built-in quality control**: Include QC checks between major stages\n\n## Decision Framework\n\n### Workflow Structure Decisions\n- **Input handling**: Design a flexible input system that can handle different metadata formats\n- **Process granularity**: Determine the appropriate level of process separation\n- **Checkpointing strategy**: Strategic placement of publishDir directives for intermediate results\n- **Parameter scoping**: Which parameters should be process-specific vs. global\n- **Execution profile design**: Development vs. production environments\n\n### Process-Specific Decisions\n- **Quality control**: FastQC pre-trim and post-trim with MultiQC integration\n- **Read trimming**: Software selection (Trimmomatic, fastp) with parameter considerations\n- **Alignment choice**: STAR vs. Salmon vs. hybrid approach\n- **Quantification strategy**: Gene-level vs. transcript-level quantification\n- **Batch processing strategy**: Sample-level parallelism vs. batch chunking\n\n### Resource Considerations\n- **Memory strategy**: How to dynamically allocate memory based on input size\n- **Storage management**: Temporary vs. persistent storage decisions\n- **Execution environment**: Local, cluster, or cloud considerations\n- **Container strategy**: Single container vs. process-specific containers\n\n## Implementation Outline\n\nCreate a project structure like:\n```\nmy_rnaseq_pipeline/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.nf              # Main workflow definition\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 nextflow.config      # Pipeline configuration\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conf/                # Environment-specific configs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 modules/             # Process definitions\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 containers/          # Dockerfiles for processes\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 bin/                 # Helper scripts\n```\n\nFocus on designing your main.nf as a high-level orchestration of modules:\n\n```groovy\n// High-level workflow structure\nworkflow {\n    reads_ch = channel.fromFilePairs(params.reads)\n    metadata_ch = channel.fromPath(params.metadata)\n    \n    FASTQC(reads_ch)\n    TRIMMING(reads_ch)\n    FASTQC_POST(TRIMMING.out)\n    ALIGNMENT(TRIMMING.out)\n    QUANTIFICATION(ALIGNMENT.out, metadata_ch)\n    MULTIQC(\n        FASTQC.out,\n        FASTQC_POST.out,\n        ALIGNMENT.out.stats,\n        QUANTIFICATION.out.stats\n    )\n}\n```\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n- **Error handling**: Build robust error detection and reporting\n- **Resume capabilities**: Structure for efficient restart after failures\n- **Monitoring**: Integrate workflow monitoring for long-running jobs\n- **Data provenance**: Ensure all pipeline parameters are captured in output\n- **Validation**: Implement input validation to prevent downstream failures\n\n## Useful Resources\n\n- [Nextflow Patterns](https://nextflow-io.github.io/patterns/) - Common design patterns\n- [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) - Collection of peer-reviewed Nextflow pipelines\n- [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf/) - Monitoring and execution platform\n- [Seqera Labs Tutorials](https://seqera.io/training/) - Advanced Nextflow training materials\n"
