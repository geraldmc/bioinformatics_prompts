These modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, do not change the DNA sequence but play critical roles in regulating gene expression. Epigenomic alterations are involved in various biological processes including development, aging, and disease pathogenesis. Advanced bioinformatics tools enable the mapping and interpretation of these complex modifications across the genome, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

      "response": "\n# Analyzing Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Data\n\n## Approach Overview\nAnalyzing WGBS data to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) involves:\n1. Quality control and preprocessing of bisulfite-converted reads\n2. Alignment to a reference genome with bisulfite-aware mappers\n3. Methylation calling at individual cytosines\n4. Identification of differentially methylated regions\n5. Biological interpretation and integration with other data types\n\n## Key Decision Points\n\n### Quality Control and Preprocessing\n- **Bisulfite conversion efficiency assessment**:\n  - Measure using spike-in controls or mitochondrial DNA\n  - Expect >98% conversion efficiency\n  - Poor conversion leads to methylation overestimation\n  - Check for bimodal quality score distributions (common in bisulfite data)\n\n- **Adapter and quality trimming considerations**:\n  - More critical for WGBS due to lower complexity\n  - Trim low-quality bases from 3' ends (Phred <20)\n  - Remove adapters with tools like Trim Galore or Trimmomatic\n  - Consider merging overlapping paired-end reads\n\n- **Technical bias correction**:\n  - M-bias plots to identify systematic errors by read position\n  - GC bias assessment and normalization\n  - Remove PCR duplicates to avoid methylation bias\n  - Account for coverage biases across CpG density spectrum\n\n### Alignment Strategy\n- **Bisulfite-aware aligner selection**:\n  -

Local smoothing leverages correlation between nearby CpGs\n  - Kernel smoothing versus fixed window approaches\n  - Statistical approaches like BSmooth\n  - Trade-off between noise reduction and resolution\n\n- **Single-CpG versus regional analysis**:\n  -

FDR control for DMR discovery\n  - Permutation-based approaches for regional testing\n  - Spatial adjustment for correlation between CpGs\n  - q-value or Benjamini-Hochberg procedures\n\n### Biological Interpretation\n- **Genomic context annotation**:\n  -
